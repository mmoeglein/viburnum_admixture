	USAGE: assoc2qqman.py <prefix.assoc.txt>
    Read the output of gemma 'prefix.assoc.txt' derived 
    from the association analysis command and performs 
    readjustment of the file to be compatible for Read
    R analysis with the package 'qqman'. Note that chromosomes
    should named as digits.
    Compatible Python27 and Python37
